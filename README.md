# Multiclass Image Classification - Dog Breeds &middot;
> The program follows a similar structure as one demonstrated in fastai courses and classifies images as Dog Breed Classification

The Project provides a step by step method to classify images into one of 100 + categories of dog breeds and goes deeper into understanding parameters such as learning rate to improve the accuracy of the models developed. The project is an attempt to the Kaggle competition for [dog-breed-identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification)

## Installing / Getting started

You need to use fastai 0.7; please follow the installation instructions [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652)  .


## Developing

### Built With
fastai 0.7, sklearn libraries

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
NVidia GPU with programming framework CUDA is helpful for training and testing the models

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Set the PATH variable to your relavant folder location
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anandpuntambekar/Dog_breeds_class.git
cd Dog_breeds_classf/
```


## Style guide

The notebook is well commented explaining in technical details each and every step of the process end to end. This includes exploring the data, Model exploration, Model selection, Model tuning, Transfer learning and Model testing

## Database
The data for the project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)
